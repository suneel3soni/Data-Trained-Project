	for literate people

	to calculate literte people I have use formula 	
		total population * (literate rate/100)	

2] So i have assume that the data for 2001 is real and for rest of the years from 2002 to 2012 i have created the data from 2001 by doing some addition to as i got the proof that from 2001 to 2012 the population is gradually increased.

3] And i have only take the 01_district_wise excel sheet for analysis as the data present in that excel sheel is more as compared to others
